## Project Overview & Technologies

- This project aims to predict the topic of a given news article using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
- It also compares the performance of both algorithms using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE) to plot the clusters. 
- The project leverages the [Newspaper3K library](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) to fetch news articles, Flask for the web interface, and [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) for financial sentiment analysis. 
- To ensure efficiency, multiprocessing is used to run each model as a separate process.

## Features

- **Topic Prediction**: Predicts the topic of a given news article using LSA and LDA by spitting out predicted keywords.
- **Web Interface**: Intuitive web interface to interact with the Flask server.
- **Multiprocessing**: Runs each model as a separate process to enhance efficiency.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses FinBERT API to predict the sentiment of the news article.
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: Uses Kaggle's CroissantML format to automatically download and store the data in parquet format.

## Installation

1. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project. The structure of the file must match that of `example_config.json`.
2. [Optional] Create a virtual python environment and initialize it.
3. Install the project requirements by running the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Note that this project requires Python 3.11.8 and on some systems you must run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## t-SNE Results

[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) was used to generate the following plots:

- [LSA](lsa.html):

- [LDA](lda.html):

Unsurprisingly, LDA does a better job at separating the articles into clusters.

## Usage

1. Change into the project directory and start the server by `python .` or `python3 .`
2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:{PORT FROM config.json}`.
